## Founder of pagarii
In 2014 I began my journey as a professional matchmaker and dating coach in Denver, Colorado. Since then, I've spent the last

5 years researching and interviewing as many experts and successful couples and possible to understand what makes

relationships lasts. To get a little idea of pagarii, and what it's all about, please visit: [pagarii](https://pagarii.wordpress.com/2018/10/09/pagarii-the-dawn-of-focused-dating/?fbclid=IwAR1i9wbHdA4tzMMf0coOZyhya9OVMh8ExMd9gS3POStMOEmCqypYFftsgqk)

I'm really excited to learn more as I become a Full Stack web developer. I am most interested in JavaScript, Node, and Vue.
